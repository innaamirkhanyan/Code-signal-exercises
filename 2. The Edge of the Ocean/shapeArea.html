2. Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the 
n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, 
side by side. You can see the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting polygons in
 the picture below.
